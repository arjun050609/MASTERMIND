<button class="collapsible">Background</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>In traditional hospital settings, the diagnostic process for a patient involves several stages that can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Initially, a nurse or Resident Medical Officer (RMO) collects basic data, such as vital signs and medical history, and then enquires about the patient's symptoms. Following this preliminary assessment, patients often experience long wait times for a doctor to become available for further examination. Once a doctor arrives, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted, which usually includes ordering various diagnostic tests—ranging from imaging scans to blood work. This stage can be prolonged based on the hospital's capacity and the availability of lab technicians. After gathering and analysing the test data, the doctor carefully considers all potential diagnoses before prescribing a treatment plan or initiating any medical intervention.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Challenges</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>This methodical approach, while intended to ensure accurate diagnosis, can result in significant delays, particularly in critical situations such as heart attacks, brain strokes, or severe traumatic injuries. In these emergencies, every minute counts, and delays can drastically impact patient outcomes, sometimes with life-threatening consequences. Additionally, the current system places a heavy burden on hospital resources, leading to overworked lab technicians and RMOs who struggle to manage both urgent cases and ongoing patient care. This strain adversely affects hospital efficiency and patient care quality.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">The Solution: MEDITRON</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>To address these challenges, we introduce the Medical Emergency Diagnostic Intervention Technology for Rapid Outcome Navigation—MEDITRON. MEDITRON is an AI-enabled medical device designed to revolutionise the emergency care diagnostic process. By rapidly analysing patient symptoms, medical history, and test data, MEDITRON delivers preliminary diagnoses with unprecedented speed and accuracy. It significantly reduces diagnostic delays in critical situations, allowing medical professionals to initiate treatment more swiftly. Additionally, by automating much of the diagnostic process, MEDITRON alleviates the workload of medical professionals and lab technicians, enabling them to focus on patient care and decision-making. MEDITRON also enhances diagnostic accuracy by minimising human error and providing AI-generated insights that physicians can cross-reference with their clinical expertise. Ultimately, MEDITRON aims to optimise resource allocation, expedite diagnosis, and improve patient outcomes in emergency healthcare.</p>
